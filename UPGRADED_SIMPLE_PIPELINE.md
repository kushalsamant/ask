# Upgraded Simple Pipeline

## 🎯 Overview

The Simple Pipeline has been **completely upgraded** to include all advanced modes from the main pipeline while maintaining its core simplicity. Now you have **4 powerful modes** in one unified interface:

1. **Simple Mode** (Default) - Classic 12-step Q&A generation
2. **Hybrid Mode** - Cross-disciplinary themes with chained questions
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Mode** - Explores intersections between categories
4. **Chained Mode** - Creates connected questions that build upon each other

## 🚀 Available Modes

### **1. Simple Mode (Default)**
```bash
python simple_pipeline.py
```
**What it does**: Classic 12-step Q&A generation with all enhancements
- Volume tracking and statistics
- Optional cover generation
- Automatic backups
- Research analysis
- Data export capabilities

### **2. Hybrid Mode**
```bash
python simple_pipeline.py hybrid
```
**What it does**: Combines cross-disciplinary themes with chained questions
- Starts with cross-disciplinary questions
- Chains deeper questions that explore intersections
- Creates progressive learning paths
- Combines breadth and depth

**Example Flow**:
```
Theme: 'sustainability_technology'
Q1: "How do Architectural Design and Construction Technology work together in sustainable building?"
Q2: "What specific BIM coordination strategies optimize the design-construction interface for sustainability?"
Q3: "How can real-time collaboration tools enhance sustainable material selection during construction?"
```

### **3. Cross-Disciplinary Mode**
```bash
python simple_pipeline.py cross-disciplinary
```
**What it does**: Explores intersections between architectural categories
- Connects multiple categories in single questions
- Finds innovative solutions at category boundaries
- Creates broader, more comprehensive content
- Explores new research directions

**Example Questions**:
- "How can Urban Planning and Digital Technology create innovative city solutions?"
- "What synergies emerge when combining Architectural Design, Construction Technology, and Digital Technology?"
- "How do Interior Environments and Engineering Systems work together for optimal building performance?"

### **4. Chained Mode**
```bash
python simple_pipeline.py chained
```
**What it does**: Creates connected questions that build upon each other
- Each question builds on the previous answer
- Creates deep, progressive exploration
- Develops comprehensive understanding
- Follows logical research paths

**Example Chain**:
```
Q1: "How can we design sustainable buildings?"
A1: "Sustainable building design involves energy efficiency, renewable materials, and passive design strategies..."

Q2: "What are the most effective passive design strategies for energy efficiency?"
A2: "Passive design strategies include orientation, thermal mass, natural ventilation..."

Q3: "How can natural ventilation be optimized in urban environments?"
A3: "Urban natural ventilation requires careful consideration of wind patterns, building heights..."
```
